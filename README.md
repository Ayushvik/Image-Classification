Image recognition implementation with **Keras**. A **CNN** is built and trained with the **CIFAR-10** dataset. Two models are trained: one without data-augmentation (77.25% accuracy) and the other with data-augmentation (78.04% accuracy). Process:

``` image_recognition.py ```
* Data processing: one-hot encoding and scaling
* Building and training the CNN
* Training the model
* Training process evaluation
* Evaluation of the model
* Saving the trained model

``` my_image_recognition.py ```
* Loading the trained model
* Predicting on the test set
* Evaluation of the predictions
* Predicting on my own images
